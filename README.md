1. I created the project in pycharm
2. I created my app using python manage.py startapp
3. I then migrated using python manage.py migrate
4. Then I created my two classes within my app models
5. I used makemigrations on my app
6. Then to create the data base for these two classes I used sqlmigrate
7. After this I migrated again using python manage.py migrate
8. During this I also made a superuser usind python manage.py makesuperuser
9. I then registered my classes in the admin.py using admin.site.register
10. then, I created custom classes on my site in the admin area
11. I created the function to view these objects, using the regular expression method we learned in class
12. Next up, in git I first initialized it with git init then did touch README.md to create this file
13. I then told it what the origin was using git remote origin add my git hub repository
14. I committed these files (git commit) then pushed them to the origin (git push origin master)
15. I then added the travis file and commited and pushed again.
16. FInally im gonna commit this file and push again and hope to get a good grade :)
